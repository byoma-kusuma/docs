# Start Coding

Congrats for making this so far!

You must be eager to start coding after spending all the time setting up your environment.

We have open tasks ranging from bugs/feature request/ enhancement/ documentation in Github for both backend and frontend.

We recommend to start with the tasks labeled good first issue to get used to the process, then tackle few small bugs, update the docs and then move onto feature additions.
In case you are not sure, feel free to reach out to the team. Over-communication is better and under communication.
Plus our team is super helpful!

- [Backend Tasks](https://github.com/byoma-kusuma/bk-portal-api/issues)
- [Frontend Tasks](https://github.com/byoma-kusuma/core.x.ui/issues)

> **âš  Reminder** Assign the issue to yourself and add a comment that you are working on it.
> This way another person won't be working on the same task.

## I found a bug, now what?

Please open a issue in Github using above two links and add as much details as you can.

This will be reviewed and prioritized for work. You can also assign it yourself if want to take this on.
